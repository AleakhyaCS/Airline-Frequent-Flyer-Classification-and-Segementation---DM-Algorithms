# Airline-Frequent-Flyer-Classification-and-Segementation---DM-Algorithms
This project implements data mining algorithms and KDD processes that include multiple data preprocessing methodologies, visualisations, model comparisons, and clustering algorithms to classify customers based on whether they will cancel their loyalty program membership, using demographic and flight activity data, and further groups them by their behaviour. This process aims to provide actionable insights for improving and personalising loyalty program benefits based on customer behaviour.
